##User Stories Administrator##

by providing their job name, company, domain and experience.
For each job, I want to assign some keywords that describe the
job. The same keyword can be used for more than 1 job.

    As an administrator, I would like to be able 
to modify any job.

even if the position is not occupied.

    As an administrator, I would like to be able to check status 
of a job, by seeing its name, if is occupied, who applied to it 
(email, phone number), when it was published, for how long, and 
how much until will expire.

------------    As an administrator, I would like to be able to view metrics 
of a specific job. The metrics must be about how many times the 
ad was viewed, how many times it was applied for that post, who 
applied to that post, and the validity of the ad.
